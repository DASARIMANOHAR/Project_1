Network ports are essential components of computer networking that help devices communicate over the internet or local networks

What Is a Network Port?
A network port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Think of it like a door or channel through which data enters or leaves a device.

Each port is identified by a port number, which ranges from 0 to 65535.

Why Are Ports Important?
Ports allow multiple services to run on a single device. For example:

Web browsing uses port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
Email might use port 25 (SMTP) or 993 (IMAP).
File transfer uses port 21 (FTP).
Types of Ports
Well-Known Ports (0–1023)
Reserved for common services (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH).

Registered Ports (1024–49151)
Used by software applications that are not as universal.

Dynamic/Private Ports (49152–65535)
Used temporarily by applications for short-term communication.

How Ports Work in Communication
When a device sends data:

It uses an IP address to identify the destination device.
It uses a port number to specify the service or application on that device.
For example:

192.168.1.10:443
This means: send data to IP 192.168.1.10 using port 443 (HTTPS).

Common Port Numbers
Port	    Protocol	 Use Case
20/21	    FTP	       File Transfer
22	      SSH	       Secure Shell
25	      SMTP	     Email Sending
53	     DNS	       Domain Name Lookup
80	     HTTP   	    Web Browsing
443	     HTTPS       Secure Web Browsing
